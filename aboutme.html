    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>My name is Sama Yacout. I am a 14-year old student at Colonel By SS.
            <br> I am from Alexandria, Egypt, and born in Kuwait. At the age of 3, I moved to Canada, 
            <br>and learned English and French. I enjoy many foods, including poutine, shawarma, 
            <br>burger, and many more! One of many places I enjoyed visiting was Toronto. During 
            <br>the summer of 2017, my family and I went to Toronto for 3 days. During those days,
            <br> we went to the CN Tower, Canada's Wonderland, the aquariam, and many more. I have 
            <br> many hobbies, including drawing, coding, reading, and more! When I am older, I 
            <br> aspire to become a software engineer. Specifically, a front-end web developper. 
            <br>Since the age of 12, I have always been interested by how websites and apps are 
            <br>formed. I have made it my goal to answer these questions. Besides coding, I really
            <br> enjoy drawing! Specifically, I enjoy drawing realistic objects with colored pencils.
            <br> I hope to further advance my drawing abilities. One of the most relaxing activities 
            <br> that I enjoy is reading. It is very calming and helps me relax my brain.</p>
